# functions

This is a project to implement higher-order functions (HOFs) in Rust. We will create functions that actually work, but we are not creating a library for practical use, so please keep this in mind.

Explanations and tests were based on MDN and Rust's Iterators.

The goal is to design all functions to be generic, and the goal is to implement as many functions as possible.
